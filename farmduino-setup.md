# Farmduino Setup

This setup describes the steps to setup a Farmduino device that has not been sold and shipped by Farmbot Inc., but was made on your own with the help of a Chinese PCB prototyp manufacturer.

## Power On
If the the power cable is DIY done, make sure the positive polarity connects to VCC (hot wire) and negative polarity to GND once plugged in. This is because the circuit is DC +24V which means it's a negative ground system. The Farmduino is powered using the Farmduino power cable with the red Molex connector. If there is no smoke and the yellow power LED is on, then it's all good so far.
