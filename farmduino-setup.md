# Smoke test
If the the power cable is DIY done, make sure the positive polarity connects to VCC (hot wire) and negative polarity to GND once plugged in. This is because the circuit is DC +24V which means it's a negative ground system. The Farmduino is powered using the Farmduino power cable with the red Molex connector. If there is no smoke and the yellow power LED is on, then it's all good so far.
